# AWS Serverless


### Setting Up AWS Cloud9
We used the AWS Cloud9 IDE to set up an environment to create a serverless react web app. After provisioning a specific development environment, run the following commands to install environment updates required for compilation & testing.

```

```

Next run the following commands to initialize an npm project and install all relevant npm packages required to write & build a react app.

```

```

Next install the local support for AWS's CodeBuild service. This allows you to avoid having to manually configure and invoke an AWS CodeBuild project. Local builds also take less time to complete.
